## Implementation

### Command-Line Interface

When you install `face_recognition`, you get two simple command-line 
programs:

* `face_recognition` - Recognize faces in a photograph or folder full for 
   photographs.
* `face_detection` - Find faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs.

#### `face_recognition` command line tool

The `face_recognition` command lets you recognize faces in a photograph or 
folder full  for photographs.

First, you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person you
already know. There should be one image file for each person with the
files named according to who is in the picture:

![known](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23582466/8324810e-00df-11e7-82cf-41515eba704d.png)

Next, you need a second folder with the files you want to identify:

![unknown](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23582465/81f422f8-00df-11e7-8b0d-75364f641f58.png)

Then in you simply run the command `face_recognition`, passing in
the folder of known people and the folder (or single image) with unknown
people and it tells you who is in each image:

```bash
$ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person
```

There's one line in the output for each face. The data is comma-separated
with the filename and the name of the person found.

An `unknown_person` is a face in the image that didn't match anyone in
your folder of known people.

#### `face_detection` command line tool

The `face_detection` command lets you find the location (pixel coordinatates) 
of any faces in an image.

Just run the command `face_detection`, passing in a folder of images 
to check (or a single image):

```bash
$ face_detection  ./folder_with_pictures/

examples/image1.jpg,65,215,169,112
examples/image2.jpg,62,394,211,244
examples/image2.jpg,95,941,244,792
```

It prints one line for each face that was detected. The coordinates
reported are the top, right, bottom and left coordinates of the face (in pixels).
 
##### Adjusting Tolerance / Sensitivity

If you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be that
the people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance value
is needed to make face comparisons more strict.

You can do that with the `--tolerance` parameter. The default tolerance
value is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:

```bash
$ face_recognition --tolerance 0.54 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person
```

If you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in order
to adjust the tolerance setting, you can use `--show-distance true`:

```bash
$ face_recognition --show-distance true ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama,0.378542298956785
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person,None
```

##### More Examples

If you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph but don't
care about file names, you could do this:

```bash
$ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/ | cut -d ',' -f2

Barack Obama
unknown_person
```

##### Speeding up Face Recognition

Face recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with
multiple CPU cores. For example, if your system has 4 CPU cores, you can
process about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by using
all your CPU cores in parallel.

If you are using Python 3.4 or newer, pass in a `--cpus <number_of_cpu_cores_to_use>` parameter:

```bash
$ face_recognition --cpus 4 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/
```

You can also pass in `--cpus -1` to use all CPU cores in your system.

#### Python Module

You can import the `face_recognition` module and then easily manipulate
faces with just a couple of lines of code. It's super easy!

API Docs: [https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io](https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/face_recognition.html).

##### Automatically find all the faces in an image

```python
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture.py)
 to try it out.

You can also opt-in to a somewhat more accurate deep-learning-based face detection model.

Note: GPU acceleration (via NVidia's CUDA library) is required for good
performance with this model. You'll also want to enable CUDA support
when compliling `dlib`.

```python
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image, model="cnn")

# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture_cnn.py)
 to try it out.

If you have a lot of images and a GPU, you can also
[find faces in batches](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_batches.py).

##### Automatically locate the facial features of a person in an image

```python
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)

# face_landmarks_list is now an array with the locations of each facial feature in each face.
# face_landmarks_list[0]['left_eye'] would be the location and outline of the first person's left eye.
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_facial_features_in_picture.py)
 to try it out.

##### Recognize faces in images and identify who they are

```python
import face_recognition

picture_of_me = face_recognition.load_image_file("me.jpg")
my_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(picture_of_me)[0]

# my_face_encoding now contains a universal 'encoding' of my facial features that can be compared to any other picture of a face!

unknown_picture = face_recognition.load_image_file("unknown.jpg")
unknown_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_picture)[0]

# Now we can see the two face encodings are of the same person with `compare_faces`!

results = face_recognition.compare_faces([my_face_encoding], unknown_face_encoding)

if results[0] == True:
    print("It's a picture of me!")
else:
    print("It's not a picture of me!")
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/recognize_faces_in_pictures.py)
 to try it out.
